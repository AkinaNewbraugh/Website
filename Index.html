<h1 align = "Center">Akina Newbraugh</h1> 
<h3 align ="Center">Hello and Welcome! My name is Akina Newbraugh. I am a sophomore in the George Washington School of Business, majoring in Business Administration with a concentration in Business Economics and Public Policy and minoring in mathematics. My professional interests include political science, business management and economics and my professional experience mainly consists of volunteer leadership roles with nonprofit organizations. From these leadership roles, I have attained many professional business skills, including great organizational skills, oral communication skills and strategic planning skills. After graduation, I am interested in pursuing a career in political and public affairs consulting, and eventually lobbying within the private sector. Recently, I have gained an interest in the Finance industry and I hope to get more involved in Global Capital Markets, and possibly pursue a career in Sales and Trading within Global Capital Markets.
